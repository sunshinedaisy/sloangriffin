          <p class="item">Shadow Cast</p>
          <p class="item-about">Shadow Cast is a 2D side scrolling game developed by myself and three other team members. As a group, we named ourselves Sunshine Daisy Studios. I was the aesthetic lead of the group; in other words, I was in charge of creating all of the environments and the design of the main characters. I designed the aesthetic of the user interface, including the main menu, instructions, and credits screens as well as the game and team logos.
            <br></br>I was also heavily involved in the creation of our story. As a part of our storyboard, I designed snapshots of the cutscenes, which I later developed into full-length videos using Final Cut Pro. I also implemented the Shadow Health, Shadow AI, and main character health scripts. In addition, I implemented death and falling triggers and scripts.
            <br></br>I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create the game's artwork. As I created the landscapes, I wanted to utilize perspective to give a sense of depth to the 2D environments. I created three base layers with three varying levels of color saturation to represent the ground and a similar variety in the trees and buildings. As a whole, I wanted the colors to stay very monochromatic to emphasize somber themes of the game.
            <br></br>The introduction of our game is shown below:
            <br></br><i>Sunshine Daisy Studios presents Shadow Cast, a game filled with dread and urgency as you race to protect the people you love from the menacing Shadows. Playing as a Viking warrior woman, you foresee an attack on your village and chieftain. Our story follows your mission to save them from the Shadows. Through many obstacles and battles against the Shadows, you gradually make your way home, but is home better off without you?
