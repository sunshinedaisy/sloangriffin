          <p class="item">ToDo App</p>
          <p class="item-about">As a part of my internship at Grooveshark, I was given the task of designing an agenda application, which I named the “ToDo App”. I began by documenting everything that needed to be included within the application. Components such as the types of pages, functionality, and allowable user customizations were listed. My research included study and assessment of the features and functionality of existing products offered in the App Store. Once I was able to determine the most important elements for the application, I began to sketch out designs and eventually create the app on Photoshop. There were several different iterations of the design, but the final product is shown here. I have displayed the three main pages of the app: the Landing Page, Detail Page, as well as a view of the apps functionality.
