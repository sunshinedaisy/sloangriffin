          <p class="item">Shade</p>
          <p class="item-about">Shade is a story about the manifestation of the evils of the world from the mind of a young boy who takes comfort in the safety of his room and companionship of his toys. This is the preview of an animated short film I created. All of the animation, lighting, music and video production was done by me. The most important aspect of this short for me was the creation of the narrative. I wanted to create a story that was artificially dark, but, by the end, you realize that it is all about finding comfort and overcoming your inner fears.</p>
